An uncertainty compiler is a tool that automatically translates original computer source code lacking explicit uncertainty analysis into code containing appropriate uncertainty representations and uncertainty propagation algorithms. We have developed an prototype uncertainty compiler along with an associated object-oriented uncertainty language in the form of a stand-alone Python library. It handles the speciﬁcations of input uncertainties and inserts calls to intrusive uncertainty quantiﬁcation algorithms in the library. The uncertainty compiler can apply intrusive uncertainty propagation methods to codes or parts of codes and therefore more comprehensively and ﬂexibly address both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties.
