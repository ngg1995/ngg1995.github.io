Vertical farming (VF) is a method of indoor agricultural production, involving stacked layers of crops, utilising technologies to increase yields per unit area. However, this emerging sector has struggled with proﬁtability and a high failure rate. Practitioners and academics call for a comprehensive economic analysis of vertical farming, but efforts have been stiﬂed by a lack of valid and available data as existing studies are unable to address risks and uncertainty that may support risk-empowered business planning. An adaptable economic analysis is necessary that considers imprecise variables and risks. The ﬁnancial risk analysis presented uses with a ﬁrst-hitting-time model with probability bounds to evaluate quasi-insolvency for two unique vertical farms. The UK farm results show that capital injection, robust data collection, frequent cleaning, efﬁcient distribution and cheaper packaging are pathways to proﬁtability and have a safer risk proﬁle. For the Japanese farm, diversiﬁcation of revenue streams like tours or education reduce ﬁnancial risk associated with yield and sales. This is the ﬁrst instance of applying risk and uncertainty quantiﬁcation for VF business models and it can support wider agricultural projects. Enabling this complex sector to compute with uncertainty to estimate ﬁnancials could improve access to funding and help other nascent industries.
