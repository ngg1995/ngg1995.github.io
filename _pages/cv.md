## Research/Teaching Assistant
## _University of Liverpool_

Alongside my PhD, I have been a teaching assistant on two modules helping to write assessments and mark student tests. I also gave guest lectures about my research area to first-year students.
Since April 2022, I have been employed casually as a research assistant at Liverpool whilst writing my PhD.

## **Research Assistant -**_Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning_

**_October 2021 - March 2022_**
I was employed on a six-month contract to research human-in-the-loop machine learning. During this time, I helped to write a literature review and researched ways to enable inductive logic programming from large datasets with binary features.  

## Graduate Transport Planner
