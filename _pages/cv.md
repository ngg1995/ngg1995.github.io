Work experience
======
## Research/Teaching Assistant
### _University of Liverpool_
**_February 2019 - Present_**

Alongside my PhD, I have been a teaching assistant on two modules helping to write assessments and mark student tests. I also gave guest lectures about my research area to first-year students.
Since April 2022, I have been employed casually as a research assistant at Liverpool whilst writing my PhD.

## **Research Assistant -**_Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning_
### _Imperial College London_
**_October 2021 - March 2022_**

I was employed on a six-month contract to research human-in-the-loop machine learning. During this time, I helped to write a literature review and researched ways to enable inductive logic programming from large datasets with binary features.  

## Graduate Transport Planner 
### _WSP_
**_November 2017 - September 2018_**

As part of this role, I helped to create computer models that predicted traffic flow and then analysed the outputted data. I also created machine learning models to predict the result of simulations faster.
